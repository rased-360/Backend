## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the **backend API** for the RaSed system — a .NET 9 REST API
that serves as the central nervous system of the platform, bridging IoT sensor data,
AI-powered detections, and real-time communication across both mobile and desktop clients.

The API handles all business logic and data persistence, maintains a persistent connection
with the MQTT broker to receive and process live sensor events, integrates with AI detection
services for automated threat analysis, exposes SignalR hubs for real-time data streaming,
and delivers push notifications via Firebase Cloud Messaging.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Install the following on your machine before running the project:

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) | **9.0+** | Required |
| [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) | **16+** | Primary database |
| [EF Core CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/core/cli/dotnet) | **9.0+** | Run: `dotnet tool install -g dotnet-ef` |
| [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) | **2022+** | Or VS Code + C# Dev Kit extension |

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rased-360/Backend.git
cd rased-api
```

### 2. Configure Environment

```bash
cp appsettings-template.json appsettings.json
```

Open `appsettings.json` and fill in all required values — see [🔐 Environment Variables](#-environment-variables) for details.

> ⚠️ `appsettings.json` is in `.gitignore` and must **never** be committed.

### 3. Restore Dependencies

```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 4. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
dotnet ef database update --project src/RaSed.Infrastructure --startup-project src/RaSed.API
```

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
dotnet run --project src/RaSed.API
```

### 🔑 Default SuperAdmin Account

On first run, the application **automatically seeds** a SuperAdmin account and all roles (`SuperAdmin`, `Admin`, `Employee`).

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Email | `superadmin@factory.com` |
| Password | `Super@1234` |
| Role | `SuperAdmin` |

> ⚠️ **Change the default password immediately** after first login in a production environment.

This account is used to log in to the **Desktop application** and create all other Admin and Employee accounts. No registration endpoint exists — all accounts are managed by the SuperAdmin.

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Copy `appsettings-template.json` → `appsettings.json` and fill in every key below.

### 🗄️ Database

| Key | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|

| `EmailSettings:FromName` | Display name for sent emails | `RaSed` |

> 💡 For Gmail: enable 2FA and use an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords) instead of your main password.

### 🖼️ Cloudinary (Media Uploads)

| Key | Description | Where to find |
|---|---|---|
| `Cloudinary:CloudName` | Your Cloudinary cloud name | [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console) |
| `Cloudinary:ApiKey` | Cloudinary API key | Cloudinary Dashboard |
| `Cloudinary:ApiSecret` | Cloudinary API secret | Cloudinary Dashboard |

Used to send push notifications to the Mobile app (Employee).

| Key | Description | Where to find |
|---|---|---|
| Firebase config | Service account JSON file | [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → Project Settings → Service Accounts |

> 💡 Place your Firebase service account JSON file (`firebase-adminsdk.json`) in the project root. It is listed in `.gitignore` and must **never** be committed.

### ⏱️ OTP Settings

Controls OTP behavior for password reset.

| Key | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `OtpSetting:ExpiryMinutes` | OTP validity duration in minutes | `5` |
| `OtpSetting:MaxLongTermAttempts` | Max total OTP requests allowed | `5` |
| `OtpSetting:ResendDelayMinutes` | Minimum wait between OTP resends (minutes) | `1` |
| `OtpSetting:MaxFailedAttempts` | Max failed verification attempts before block | `3` |

### 🧹 Cleanup Settings (Background Jobs)

Controls all automated database cleanup jobs. All four services are configured here — no hardcoded values anywhere in the codebase.

```json
"CleanupSettings": {
  "Violations": {
    "RetentionDays": 60,
    "IntervalHours": 24
  },
  "FireEvents": {
    "RetentionDays": 30,
    "IntervalHours": 24,
    "InitialDelayMinutes": 1
  },
  "RefreshTokens": {
    "ExpiredRetentionDays": 1,
    "RevokedRetentionDays": 35,
    "IntervalHours": 24
  },
  "Otp": {
    "IntervalHours": 1
  }
}
```

| Key | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `CleanupSettings:Violations:RetentionDays` | Days to keep violation records | `60` |
| `CleanupSettings:Violations:IntervalHours` | How often the violation cleanup job runs | `24` |
| `CleanupSettings:FireEvents:RetentionDays` | Days to keep resolved fire event records | `30` |
| `CleanupSettings:FireEvents:IntervalHours` | How often the fire event cleanup job runs | `24` |
| `CleanupSettings:FireEvents:InitialDelayMinutes` | Delay before first run after startup | `1` |
| `CleanupSettings:RefreshTokens:ExpiredRetentionDays` | Days to keep expired (non-revoked) tokens | `1` |
| `CleanupSettings:RefreshTokens:RevokedRetentionDays` | Days to keep revoked tokens for reuse detection | `35` |
| `CleanupSettings:RefreshTokens:IntervalHours` | How often the token cleanup job runs | `24` |
| `CleanupSettings:Otp:IntervalHours` | How often the OTP cleanup job runs | `1` |

> 💡 `RevokedRetentionDays` must always be ≥ your refresh token lifetime (30 days for employees). The default of 35 gives a safety buffer for the full reuse detection window.

### 📊 Performance Settings

Controls employee performance scoring calculation.

| Key | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `PerformanceSettings:WindowDays` | Evaluation period in days | `30` |
| `PerformanceSettings:PenaltyPerViolation` | Score points deducted per violation | `10` |

---

## 🛡️ Authentication & Authorization

RaSed uses **JWT Bearer Tokens** with **Refresh Token** rotation. There are two separate authentication flows depending on the client:

| Client | Login Endpoint | Refresh | Logout | Revoke |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🖥️ Desktop (Admin, SuperAdmin) | `POST /api/admin/auth/login` | `POST /api/admin/auth/refresh-token` | `POST /api/admin/auth/logout` | `POST /api/admin/auth/revoke-token` |
| 📱 Mobile (Employee) | `POST /api/employee/auth/login` | `POST /api/employee/auth/refresh-token` | `POST /api/employee/auth/logout` | `POST /api/employee/auth/revoke-token` |

### Using the Token

After login, include the returned token in every protected request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <access_token>
```

### Roles & Access

| Role | Description | Client |
|---|---|---|
| `SuperAdmin` | Manages Admin and Employee accounts, full system access | 🖥️ Desktop |
| `Admin` | Manages Employees, Sensor Dashboard, Violations, and Reports | 🖥️ Desktop |
| `Employee` | Views own data, reports issues, receives violation notifications | 📱 Mobile |

### Token Lifetime

| User type | Access token | Refresh token | Reuse detection window |
|---|---|---|---|
| Admin / SuperAdmin | 15 minutes | 3 days | 35 days after revocation |
| Employee | 60 minutes | 30 days | 35 days after revocation |

### Security Rules

| Rule | Detail |
|---|---|
| 🔒 **Password policy** | Min 8 chars · uppercase · lowercase · digit · special character |
| 🚫 **Account lockout** | Locked for **5 minutes** after **5** failed login attempts |
| 🚦 **Rate limiting** | Max **5 login requests / minute / IP** — returns `429 Too Many Requests` |
| 🔄 **Token rotation** | Every refresh issues a new token and invalidates the old one |
| 🕵️ **Reuse detection** | Using an already-rotated token immediately revokes all active sessions |
